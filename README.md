# caesar_cipher

# Caeser Cipher: 
    # takes a letter in plaintext and is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet
        # left shift of 3 D would become A. 
        # right shift of 3 D would become G.

# Task
    # X implement a cipher that takes a string and shift factor and outputs the modified string
    # X remember how to convert string into a number (.to_i)
    # X wrap z to a
    # keep same case
